iptools relies on Boost.Asio for IP address conversions and Boost.Regex for
working with IP addresses. This requires more than just Boost headers (i.e.
you can't just install the BH R package and have iptools work).

The easiest way to satisfy the requirements is to use the comprehensive Boost
package available on most Unix-like systems:

       Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install libboost-all-dev
Fedora/CentOS/RedHat: yum install boost-devel
         OS X/Darwin: brew install boost

You may be able to get it working on some systems with the BH R package and just
installing the Regex and System packages (if available separately on your system):

       Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev
Fedora/CentOS/RedHat: yum install boost-regex boost-system
