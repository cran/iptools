NOTE: iptools does not compile under Windows at this time due to the use of two
Boost libraries (Regex and System/ASIO) that require extensive setup on Windows
systems (i.e. it won't just work with the BH R package installed and plain
Rtools compilation).

Unix Variants
=============

You will need a working, fairly complete Boost installation to use iptools.

Most Unix variants should be able to meet this requirement with either:

  # debian/ubuntu-like environments
  apt-get install libboost-all-dev

or

  # redhat/centos/fedora-like environments
  yum install boost-devel

or

  # os x/darwin-like environments with homebrew
  brew install boost

There is a configure script that checks for the presence of Boost,
Boost Regex and Boost ASIO. Compilation will fail with diagnostic messages
noting what could not be found.

iptools installation and functionality have been tested on:

  - CentOS 7.1 / R 3.2.0
  - Ubuntu Precise & Trusty (64-bit) / R 3.2.1
  - OS X 10.10.3 / R 3.2.1
